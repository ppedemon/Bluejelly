The Bluejelly project relies on two libraries, which includes in 
its binary distribution:

 - ObjectWeb ASM. Copryright 2000-2011 INRIA, France Telecom
 - Scala library. Copyright 2002-2012 EPFL, Lausanne

In addition, it uses for testing purposes only Scalacheck, Copyright 
2009-2012 Artima Inc. 

Since we are purposedly not relying on Maven nor sbt, we are distributing 
the three aforementioned libraries in the Bluejelly source code. The file
Bluejelly.Libs/lib/3rd-party-licences contains the corresponding licenses 
and disclaimers for each library.
